# E-Commerce Website (Practice Project)

This is a basic e-commerce website I built as part of my front-end development practice.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

I followed a tutorial to learn how to build a modern e-commerce front-end layout using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. My goal was to understand real-world website structure and improve my coding skills by building a working product page, categories, and cart interface.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Did

- Rebuilt the project step-by-step by following a tutorial
- Practiced responsive layout design
- Learned how to structure e-commerce sections (home, product grid, navbar, footer, etc.)

## âœ¨ Features I Added Myself

I didnâ€™t just follow the tutorial blindly â€” I explored and implemented my own improvements:

- âœ… Custom product cards with hover effects
- âœ… Added cart icons, search bar UI
- âœ… Minor UI tweaks and animations using CSS
- âœ… (Optional) Added JS for a basic cart counter / product filter (if you added this)

## ðŸ“‚ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (basic DOM manipulation)

## ðŸ§  Purpose of This Project

This project is purely for *learning and skill-building*.  
Itâ€™s not a commercial or original product, but a showcase of:
- My growing front-end skills
- My ability to follow, understand, and build from reference
- My effort to go beyond the tutorial by adding personal enhancements
